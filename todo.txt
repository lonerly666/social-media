- Reconstruct likelist for posts and comments
    client fix:
        -gets the likers information only when the user clicked into the likeList and then update the likerlist
        - for efficiency (pagination), we get 10 likers at first and then infinite scoll if there is more likes
    server fix:
        -remove current design where getting all likers image and nickname from the server when getting all posts/comments


- Pagination for posts, notifications, comments, friend requests
