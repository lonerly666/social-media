- Reconstruct likelist for posts and comments
    client fix:
        -gets the likers information only when the user clicked into the likeList and then update the likerlist (done)
        - for efficiency (pagination), we get 10 likers at first and then infinite scroll if there is more likes 
    server fix:
        -remove current design where getting all likers image and nickname from the server when getting all posts/comments (done)


- Pagination for posts, notifications, comments, friend requests (left notifications and friend reqeusts)

-Change API url (done)

- Implement fetch more data for likeList and tagList

- Show friends who is online 

- Sort target comment to the top if commenters is in user friend list or when user clicked through notifications
